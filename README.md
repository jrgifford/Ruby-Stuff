#OH HAI YOU'VE FOUND ME

This is for all the various odds and ends that I write and want to share

with the world. 

So, we've got the following:

  * `boxcar` - this (tries) to send a [@boxcar](http://boxcar.io) notification to me.
    - `Gemfile`
    - `main.rb`

  * `twitter-bot` - this is a twitter bot that replies with a stock comment to tweets in a given search result thingy.

    - `main.rb`
    - `tokens.rb` - you'll need to add this yourself, [example here](https://gist.github.com/1218269)
  * `stackexchange` - this is another (failed) attempt at using the stackexchange API.

  * `twitter-post` - this posts a tweet, and confirms it.
    - `main.rb`
    - `tokens.rb` - you'll need to add this yourself, [example here](https://gist.github.com/1218269)
  * `twitter-search` - this simply a twitter search that displays the latest `askubuntu` tweets.
    - `main.rb` - self explanatory.
